I came from Brazil 6 years ago and I was supposed to stay only for a year to become fluent in English. After my first months, I had grown to love this country and decided I wanted to stay. My past work experience is in the area of customer and property services. Working as an operational supervisor, I was in charge of managing staff and overseeing commercial cleaning operations.<br> 
Some of my hobbies include endurance road cycling, going on a hike with friends and I enjoy going to film festivals in Melbourne. My IT experience is limited to my years of high school when I took a course to learn how to create and code soccer playing robots. That was very fun and rewarding and has motivated me to pursue a career in IT. Also, I am attracted to how technologies are constantly developing and particularly to how those changes can impact business and people. <br>
Working on a variety of teams and projects during my career is something I am definitely looking forward to.</p>
