<p><strong>Overview:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A smart mirror is a two-way mirror that provides an inbuilt display located behind the glass through the use of technology. The smart mirror is designed for individuals that want to maximise the space in the house and be able to receive information from it. It creates ease for access for the individual as it has the ability to be controlled through voice or phone. The mirror provides several different types of functions, such as the ability to create daily reminders, the current time, weather, etc. , to help serve the purpose of displaying information dependent on what the user prefers through ability to customise in settings. The design is to create a &ldquo;main&rdquo; mirror, preferred to be located in the living/lounge room, where there are smaller versions which can be accessed in different rooms around the house allowing it to be more accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To motivate more households to use voice assistants, we will redesign the appearance of the mirror to make it more attractive. We will build our voice assistant in a mirror because this is an ordinary object already found in every home.</p>
<p>The smart mirror will be an appliance that will be easy to use and capable of doing an extensive variety of tasks to suit everyone&rsquo;s needs. It will assist people to have more time to spend doing things that really matter to them.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The Smart Mirror acts as a personal assistant, performing tasks for users via voice command Additionally, users will be able to control the Smart Mirror from their paired devices such as smartwatches or mobiles in the event of them being out of the vocal range. The user commands trigger readily available features that will allow users to go by their daily lives with convenience. These features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calendar and reminders: </strong>A calendar application lets users organise their days with a personalised schedule, allowing them to plan events, set reminders and stay organised. Since the mirror is synced with devices, reminders are also sent to their mobiles and smartwatches.</li>
<li><strong>News: </strong>Local news reports can be viewed upon user command, which is displayed in text form or video.</li>
<li><strong>Weather: </strong>The Smart Mirror will have an in-built local weather forecast that will also display warnings in case of emergencies, such as floods, earthquakes, extreme wind or extremely hot weather. Additionally, room temperature is displayed.</li>
<li><strong>Health/Fitness and Sleep analysis: </strong>Users can track their health, fitness and sleep on their devices, which the Smart Mirror can access to give feedback and recommendations to assist in reaching goals and optimal health/fitness.</li>
<li><strong>Music: </strong>The user is able to play music via their preferred music app, as well as turn on their connected speakers.</li>
<li><strong>Security control: </strong>If the user has smart security cameras, they will be able to access them through the Smart Mirror. They can view their security cameras within the mirror and if it believes there is suspicious activity, will alert the user. Users can then choose to call emergency services or ignore the alert.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Smartwatch feature: </strong>A special feature included is a smartwatch feature. The smartwatch tracks the user's heart rate and is able to understand their emotions and health. From this, the watch will ask permission to play music on the Smart Mirror based on their mood. Another benefit is health tracking. If the user shows signs of emergency, it will alert emergency contacts on their mobile as well as alert the Smart Mirror, which will display the user&rsquo;s location for other users at home to see.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tools and Technologies:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi comes in two types of models, A and B. The main difference between model A and model B is the amount of USB ports. Model A board consumes less power, contains 1 USB port and it does not contain an Ethernet port. However, the model B board includes an Ethernet port, 2 USB ports and uses more power comparison to model A. We will be using model B+ for the project simply because our AI Smart Mirror requires a relatively high power supply and needs to have more than one USB port. The AI Smart Mirror requires a display screen, in which a microphone is installed along with a sound system to allow the user to get feedback. A motherboard is used to allow communication between the user, AI system, and other hardware components such as processors, RAM, and hard-drive. To keep the smart mirror thin, these components will be external and have a cord connecting to the mirror. To allow calls without the internet, a micro-sim is required to insert into the system. The AI Smart Mirror also needs a software (Raspberry Pi) that allows both Android and iOS devices to work with the mirror. We will also be using the Mango Mirror app to sync with each mirror as well as sync with phones and smartwatches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skills Required:</strong></p>
<p>One piece of special hardware we will have to work with is a Raspberry Pi. I personally do not have any experience with a Raspberry Pi machine and would have to learn the ins and outs of the system. I am unaware if there are any special instructions when it comes to loading code onto the system or to even turn the system on. In terms of software, we would probably code in Java to make things simple, as well our group has the most experience in Java, however that experience is limited. I think the software is where our group poses the biggest challenge, none of us have much coding experience, and the experience we do have is relatively basic compared to what we would like to achieve. Our software would need to be IoT enabled to connect to the user&rsquo;s calendar and other services which could impose a challenge with network protocols and such. Lastly, the mirror would need to interface with an Android or IOS device that the user has. The remote device would be used for managing the mirror and initial setup. Our group has no experience with this either, adding to the software challenge of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
<p>If the smart mirror is successful, it will provide the user information to start the day as the purpose of the smart mirror is to use the technology we have to make our lives easier and focus on the more important tasks. The mirror will be convenient for the user as it allows the user to multitask, whether they want the machine to display a recipe as the user is cooking, or feeding the user information such as the news, weather or any upcoming schedules when they are cleaning the house or doing other important tasks by saving the user time and make the users life easier.&nbsp;</p>
