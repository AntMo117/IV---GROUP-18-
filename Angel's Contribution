I am an 19 year old boy from mainland China. My family immigrated from China to Melbourne in 2014, and since then I started High School here. My parents both can speak fluent Spanish because they used to work in a South American country called Argentina, but unfortunately, I never had a chance to learn Spanish with them because they are always busy with their work. My interest in IT is network security, although I only have little knowledge about it but I would really like to learn more about it.
