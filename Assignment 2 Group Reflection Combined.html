<h1/> Group Relection <h1/>
<p>Our team was able to collaborate with each other successfully, working with one another and efficiently getting our tasks done. The communication between us was great and we never had any conflict, which made working together so easy. Our group worked very well with one another as everyone was able to communicate their ideas freely and acknowledge each member's point of view. Each individual member was able to complete the allocated task given by the group which then the individual members to update the group on progress or the completed work at the next meeting. The interview conducted by our team members helped us understand more of the IT industry and jobs expectations we may have. What surprised most of the group members was the ability of each individual to work together as a group in order to complete the assignment to the best of our ability and also create friendship bonds. One thing that could be improved was the communication between one of our members. There was a mix up where we had been contacting a librarian from RMIT Vietnam, thinking that it was our team member due to their shared name. The librarian continued to tell us that he would be of assistance so we assumed he was in our team to help get resources and learning material. This led to confusion for the past few weeks but eventually we found out that the real team member was actually a student, who reached out to us in Google Docs. Due to this incident, we were able to acknowledge our mistake and clear it up, welcoming the member to the team and allocating any tasks that need to be completed for them to contribute to the group. This was a learning experience for us, teaching us that we should always double check each member’s emails. In regard to GitHub, it was very confusing initially. As we continued to use it, the easier it became to understand. Though, our group believes that the GitHub contribution branches are not a good reflection of our individual contributions as Hien does not have a contribution branch on GitHub due to the certain incident, however he was able to still contribute to the assignment though external sources. Our group collaborated through Microsoft Teams and external sources, where most of the work was done over the external source, which was then copied over to the GitHub branch where we were able to combine our work to our final copy. It is a bit tedious and many errors would occur, making it difficult and frustrating to use. Overall, our group has worked well together and have put in our best effort which can be seen through the collaboration of the members, communication and seeking help and completing the task that is given to the best of their ability. <p/>

<p>I don’t have any complaints at all in regard to the performance of our group as I firmly believe we make a great team. The group worked extremely well together, we all respected and got along with one another. There were no issues with the communication. When we needed to reach out to a certain member, we could do so at any given time and rely on one another. There was never a moment where conflict occurred and everyone showed enthusiasm when assigned tasks. Each person demonstrated great teamwork skills and there was a consistency in completing tasks, where each member showed they put in a great amount of effort. There was never a moment of doubt and I felt I could count on each person to do an amazing job. When it came to sharing ideas, we all listened and were open to hearing different points of views. Despite there being a mix-up with one of our members, there were no hard feelings and the team was welcoming. That member displayed great technical skills and our team was able to further progress in our assignment. Each member possessed great skills in communication and patience, further displaying their drive to do well, which I believe is what makes us a great team. <p/>

<p>I believe that everyone in our group has contributed a fair amount as the tasks performed in this assignment were spread out and everyone has completed their own personal share. The only problem that occurred during our group on assignment 2 was the confusion or mix up that occurred to the member in our group that was mistaken as a librarian working in Vietnam. We were all capable in completing the tasks given on time through teamwork and communication. Our group worked very well with each other as everyone was able to communicate their ideas freely and each member's point of view. Due to the accident, we were able to acknowledge our mistake and clear it up, welcoming them to the team and allocate any tasks that need to be completed for the member to contribute to the group. Overall, I believe that our group has worked well together and have put in our best effort which can be seen through the collaboration of the members, communication and seeking help and completing the task that is given to the best of their ability.<p/>

<h1> Ary <h1/>
<p>I think we formed a well engaged group who were motivated to do well in the assignment. We hold two meetings each week and the other days we could easily reach each other through chat or email. All members of our group contributed to the final result of the assignment.<p/>
<p>During our meeting we acknowledged each other’s ideas and engaged in productive   discussions.<p/>
<p>An aspect that could be improved would be to have tasks delegated earlier. This would have assisted us to plan the work better and be comfortable knowing that the job would have been done well and on time. A project timeline could have contributed too.<p/>
<p>One fact that surprised me was the presence of Hien in the meetings of our last week. Due to miscommunications Hien were not able to find where we were meeting weekly. That did not stop Hien to contribute with his individual work and once he joined our meeting he was willing to help with all pending tasks.<p/>
<p>From this group work I have learned that people may have different expectations and motivations for a project and as part of a group we have to be understanding of it and learn how to arrive at an agreement.<p/>

<h1> Angel <h1/>
<p>I believe that everyone has contributed to the best of their ability and I was very surprised how well our team works with each other and we have formed a good relationship with each other. Despite that, I have to be absent from the first few meetings due to a work routine crush, so I sent a message to the group chat and I was ready receive some complaints but, Ary, Melanie, Derek and Patrick understood my situation and said they will considering arrange a different time where everyone’s free and able to attend the group meeting, and that's why the meeting was changed to Friday. Our team has gone through not only my “work problem” but also “Hien’s”. We misadded the Hien from Vietnam to our MS Team and was wondering why this Hien doesn't do any work at all and we have reported to Mr Sun. But lately, we found out that the Hien we added is a librarian from Vietnam but the one we added to the Google Doc is the right Hien, from Australia, which we have been leaving him in the dark and blocking him from for the majority of the group meetings. Eventually, we fixed the problem and despite all these problems, it was just surprising and amazing that we all got to finish the work. Our group has gone through the toughest and difficult time and we are still able to manage and get our work done, absolutely love my teammates, they are the best.<p/>

<h1> Patrick <h1/>
<p>I was surprised on how well our group got to know one another and we have become friends with one another. Other groups I have worked with have been strictly business, I can see being friends with all these group members well after this class concludes. I think that our conversations when on our calls could be improved. They can have a lot of tangents which can be distracting, it is sometimes my fault and I need to work on that. One thing I have learned while working in this group is everyone works differently, and it is a “give n take” relationship. You need to adapt to how your other group members work. I believe that the GitHub contribution branches are not a good reflection of our individual contributions. For example, Hien does not have a contribution branch because of his situation however he has made most of, if not all our website. Another example would be that I have combined all our individual contributions for the sections of the project into one main file and put it in the master branch. That work will not be reflected in my contribution branch. However other members have all their work in there. The branches can be used as a supplement to the feedback; however, they do not tell the entire story of the contributions.<p/>

<h1> Hien <h1/>
<p>Despite the miscommunications and mix up early in the assignment, which left me confused for a bit, I was able to bounce back and get right to work as my team eased me in smoothly and sorted out what I could work on. I greatly admire how organised and motivated the team was and they were like robots in the way they completed the tasks very swiftly and precisely. As robots they were, they also have personalities that are very friendly and chill because they are straight-foward and easy to talk to, and also because we all found the mix up situation to be amusing due to its randomness. Overall, I think our team worked very well together as we all played into our strengths and weaknesses, complementing one another.<p/>
